## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to be a programmer?**  
A: No! This is about systems fundamentals, not programming. Basic bash is included, but you won't write complex code.

**Q: Can I skip modules?**  
A: Not recommended. Modules build on each other. Start with Module 01 for best understanding.

**Q: How do I practice?**  
A: **Type every command yourself** (no copy-paste). See the output. Understand the why. Then review solutions.

**Q: Can I use macOS?**  
A: Mostly yes. Core commands work. Some Linux-specific tools (systemd) won't be available.

**Q: I'm stuck on an exercise. What do I do?**  
A: 1) Re-read the README for that concept  
2) Check the troubleshooting section  
3) Review the solution  
4) Try a simpler version first  
5) Ask in GitHub discussions

**Q: How does this help with job interviews?**  
A: Module 16 has interview questions. Understanding these fundamentals helps you think through system design problems systematically.

**Q: Is this free?**  
A: Yes! Completely free and open-source.

**Q: How long before I can get a job?**  
A: That depends on your background. This gives you the **foundation**. Real experience comes from applying these concepts to actual systems.
